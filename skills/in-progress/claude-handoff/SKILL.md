Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Instead of saving it, launch a background agent seeded with the document as its prompt: `claude --bg "<handoff document>"`. It starts in the current working directory and returns immediately; the user manages it with `claude agents`.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, which suggests skills that the agent should invoke.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information — the document becomes the agent's prompt.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
